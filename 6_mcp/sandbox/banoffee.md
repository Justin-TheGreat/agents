# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients:

**For the Crust:**

*   1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs
*   1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
*   6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted

**For the Whipped Cream:**

*   2 cups (480ml) cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
*   1/4 cup confectioners’ sugar or granulated sugar
*   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
*   Optional toppings: chocolate shavings, chopped nuts, or toffee bits for garnish

**For the Pie:**

*   1 and 1/4 cups dulce de leche
*   2 large bananas, sliced

## Instructions:

1.  **Make the crust:** Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
2.  Grind graham crackers into fine crumbs using a food processor.
3.  Stir graham cracker crumbs and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl.
4.  Stir in the melted butter until the mixture is coarse and sandy.
5.  Pour the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish.
6.  Press the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides of the dish to form a compact crust.
7.  Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.
8.  **Make the whipped cream:** Whip heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form (about 3-4 minutes).
9.  Spread dulce de leche on top of the crust.
10. Arrange banana slices in 1-2 layers on top of the dulce de leche.
11. Spread whipped cream on top of the bananas.
12. Refrigerate pie uncovered for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
13. Garnish with toppings before serving, if desired.
14. Cover and store leftover pie in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

## Notes:

*   **Make Ahead Instructions:** The crust can be stored tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before using. Dulce de leche can be made up to 2 weeks in advance and stored in the refrigerator. The assembled pie can be prepared up to 1 day in advance and stored uncovered in the refrigerator.
*   **Dulce de Leche:** You can use store-bought dulce de leche or make your own by baking sweetened condensed milk in a water bath at 350°F (177°C) for about 2 hours, or until caramelized.
*   **Bananas Browning:** To prevent browning, squeeze a few drops of fresh lemon juice over the banana slices before layering them in the pie.
*   **Non-US Readers:** If graham crackers are unavailable, you can use 200g of ground digestive biscuit crumbs with 1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar and 6 Tablespoons (85g) melted butter for the crust. Pre-bake for 16-17 minutes.
